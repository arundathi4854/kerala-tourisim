    <h1>Allapuzha</h1>
    <p>
        Alappuzha (Alleppey) is known as ‘the Venice of the East’. Offering the best tourist places in Alleppey, this charming place is the hub of Kerala’s backwaters and is home to a huge network of backwaters and more than thousand houseboats. The houseboats you find in the backwaters of Alappuzha are in fact a reworked version of the Kettuvallams of olden times. Kettuvallam is a Malayalam word, ‘Kettu’, means living structures and ‘Vallom’ means boat. In the olden days, kettuvallam or boat with a thatched roof that covers over wooden hulls was used to carry tons of rice and spices.The modern houseboats are equipped with all the comforts of a good hotel room like air conditioners, modern toilets, cozy living rooms, a kitchen and even a balcony for angling. An uninterrupted view of life in the backwaters fringed with coconut trees can be enjoyed from a houseboat. A perfect place to unwind with its laidback canals and lush greenery. The Alappuzha beach with a 137-year-old pier extending into the sea and an old 17th-century lighthouse built by the Portuguese add to the magic of the place. It is famous for its boat races, marine products, and coir industry.

      <h4>Place to visit in Allapuzha</h4>
      <h5>1.Alleppey Beach</h5>
      <p>The iconic Alleppey beach is the perfect place to relax on a quiet and subtle evening. The waters of the Arabian Sea look majestic from the white sandy shores. If lucky, one can also view the dolphins from the beach. Nevertheless, the waters are not safe for swimming due to the strong currents especially during the monsoons.</p>
      <h5>2.Karumadikkuttan</h5>
      <p>Karumadikkuttan refers to the local name for the 9th century black granite statue of Buddha found abandoned at a nearby stream called Karumady thodu. The Statue is unfortunately missing its entire left half but has now been conserved by the Kerala State Government.</p>
      <h5>3.Marari Beach</h5>
      <p>Located almost 11 kilometers from Alleppey, Marari Beach is famous for its Ayurvedic centers and stylish beach resorts. The Shoreline is covered with long rows of coconut trees and is a great place to tie a hammock and spend the afternoon beside the clean and calm waters.</p>
      <h5>4.Kerala Backwaters</h5>
      <p>Giving Alleppey the moniker ‘The Venice of the East’, Kerala backwater canals attract thousands of tourists to Alleppey each year. The snake boat races and the houseboat cruises are a must do activity in Alleppey. Owing to its rich bird and marine life, the backwaters are the best place to try some extravagant seafood.</p>
      <h5>5.Krishnapuram Palace</h5>
      <p>The iconic Travancore style castle, The Krishnapuram Palace was built by Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma in the 18th century. Today the palace is a major tourist attraction and also contains a small museum maintained by the Archeological department of Kerala. Do visit for witnessing the breathtaking Kerala style architecture and several antiquities from the Travancore era.</p>
      <h5>6.Mannarasala Temple</h5>
      <p>Located amidst lush green surroundings, the Mannarasala Temple is dedicated to the Hindu deity Nagaraja. While the origins of the temple are shrouded with Hindu legends, it is one of the major pilgrim spots with a typical Kerala temple architecture. The amazing architecture and the 30,000 images of various mythical snakes, makes it a must visit spot.</p>
