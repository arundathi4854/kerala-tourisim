        <h1>PALAKAD</h1>
        <p>The quaint town of Palakkad in central Kerala boasts of picturesque landscape, tranquil scenery and clear backwaters. Also known as Palghat, Pallakad is located near a wide low pass in the Western Ghats mountain ranges. Palakkad is the land of Palmyras and Paddy Fields and is famous as the chief granary of Kerala.

            Palakkad gets its name from pala trees which once dominated the area. This is the area which links Kerala to Tamil Nadu and perhaps does so in a cultural sense too, since the language spoken in the villages here is Tamil, unlike the rest of the state where Malayalam is prevalent. 
            
            Palakkad is known for the ruins of Tipu Sulthan's Fort, four dams and one of the first amusement parks of Kerala - Fantasy Park. Some other locations that can be visited in the area include the Palakkad Fort, Silent Valley National Park, Pothundy Dam, Jain Temple, Dhoni waterfalls, Walayar Dam etc.</p>

        <h4>Places to visit in Palakad</h4>
        <h5>1.Palakkad Fort – To Revisit History</h5>
        <p>The well-preserved Palakkad Fort features on all Palakkad sightseeing tours as it introduces guests to the history of Palakkad right from the rule of Zamorin to the Mysore Sultans and eventually the British. Built in 1766 A.D by Hyder Ali, it is also known as the Tipu Sultan Fort and is among the highest visited Palakkad tourist spots.</p>
        <h5>2.Sree Vadakkanthara Bhagavathy Temple</h5>
        <p>The Sree Vadakkanthara Bhagavathy Temple is one of the revered temples in Palakkad and even visited by devotees from neighbouring states. The temple is based on the legend of Kannagi and a major festival ‘Vela’ is conducted here every three years, meaning the next one will be in 2022! It’s one of the best places in Palakkad to observe Hindu rituals and festivities.</p>
        <h5>3.Dhoni falls</h5>
        <p>Dhoni is a tiny hamlet near Palakkad and is best known for its natural wealth. Paying a visit to these falls is truly one of the magical things to do in Palakkad. The Dhoni waterfalls and the forest combined together offer a reprieve from the heat and humidity of Palakkad. It is one of the best places to visit in Palakkad for a day trip. The forest is a part of western ghats and is ideal for bathing. This is one of the most beautiful waterfalls in Palakkad.</p>
        <h5>4.Malampuzha Dam – Jaw-Dropping Views</h5>
        <p>The Malampuzha Dam has become one of the best tourist attractions in Palakkad. Opened in 1955, this beautiful park and dam have manicured lawns and still waters perfect for a visit during the monsoons. It is the only one among Palakkad tourist spots to have a functioning ropeway.</p>
        <h5>5.Nelliyampathy Hills</h5>
        <p>About 60 KM from Palakkad lie the Nelliyampathy Hills, one of the far-off places to visit near Palakkad whose cloud-covered mountains are a delight! The well-laid road and beautiful scenery along the way including the Pothundy Dam and Palakkad Gap make it one of the best tourist places in Kerala for a one day trip.</p>
        <h5>6.Silent Valley National Park </h5>
        <p>The Silent Valley is one of the best places to visit in Palakkad and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The rich biodiversity can be observed all along the national park including animals like elephants, tigers, lion-tailed macaques, and Malabar giant squirrels. The park is among the best places to visit near Palakkad for an eco-friendly holiday.</p>
