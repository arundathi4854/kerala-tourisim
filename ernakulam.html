    <h4>Places to visit in Ernakulam</h4>
    <h5>1.The Museum of Mattancherry</h5>
    <p> A stroll through the lanes of Fort Kochi will definitely attract you to the rustic and old-fashioned neighbourhood of Mattancherry. It is said that back in the days, this cheri (street), was lined with mutton butchers, and so it ended up being called “Muttoncherry” which over the years evolved into “Mattancherry”. Today the place exhibits centuries-old architectures and various social and cultural imprints left behind by foreigners. Declared as a heritage site by the government, Mattancherry has been an inspiration to historians, film-makers, travellers and artistes alike. Amongst all the Ernakulam tourist places, this museum is one of the most prominent attractions.</p>
    <h5>2.Vypeen Island</h5>
    <p>Vypeen is one of the popular places to visit in Ernakulam in one day and certainly one of the best islands in Kerala. A short and beautiful ferry ride from the city will take to this serene island which is dotted with beaches, backwaters and an array of restaurants and hotels. A desktop worthy scenery away from the bustling environment is what makes Vypeen island one of the best places to visit in Ernakulam for lovers. Location: Kochi, Kerala.</p>
    <h5>3.Thattekkad Bird Sanctuary</h5>
    <p>One of the first bird sanctuaries in Kerala and undeniably a haven for nature enthusiasts. In the words of Salim Ali (world famous ornithologist), Thattekkad is the “richest bird sanctuary in India” since it is home to hundreds of different endangered species of migratory birds. This thick deciduous forest has plantations of mahogany, teak, rosewood and rubber running through it. Make sure to bring along a pair of binoculars to get a glimpse of the birdlife. The best time to visit would be between November and March. </p>
    <h5>4.Cherai Beach</h5>
    <p>Located on the north end of Vypin island in Kochi, Cherai beach is a 15 km stretch of wild and rugged beauty. Although not overwhelmed by hotels or major restaurants, the beach is dotted with small shacks selling local snacks like pakoras and chips. Stunning lagoons, wide paddy fields and coconut grooves adorn the road to the beach. Ernakulam sightseeing is not complete without a visit to Cherai beach. Location: Ernakulam, Kerala</p>
    <h5>5.Folklore Museum</h5>
    <p>Folklore Museum is one of the popular tourist spots in the city. It is a three storied complex that showcases cultural exhibits and tribal artefacts. The Museum design was greatly inspired by the Malabar architecture. The museum is opened to the public from 9: 30 Am to 7 PM on a regular basis. </p>
    <h5>6.Chottanikara Bhagavathy Temple</h5>
    <p>This is the most visited and highly revered Hindu temple down south. The temple is believed to be 1500 year old where the goddess Chottanikkara Bhagavathy Amman and the Keezhu Kaavu Bhadrakali Amman are worshipped as healing goddesses. A continuous practice of worshipping the deities in this temple is believed to cure life-threatening diseases.

        The temple premises houses a Pala tree which is pierced with thousands of nails, the reason being patrons who are cured of mental maladies drive a nail across the tree. Men are required to open their shirts before they enter the premises, while women are requested to be dressed in Indian attire to offer reverence.
