      <h4>Places to visit in kannur</h4>
      <h5>1.Payyambalam beach</h5>
      <p>
        The impeccably unspoilt Payyabalam beach is adorned with sparkling pearls of golden sand and foamy white waves of the Arabian Sea. The highlight of Kannur and one of the many beautiful beaches of Kerala, it has an incredibly peaceful and inviting aura.
      </p>
      <h5>2.St Angelo's Fort</h5>
      <p>
        St Angelo's Fort is definitely one of the most popular and frequently visited attractions of Kannur and for more reasons than one. The polished yet prehistoric structure of this fortress oozes with unadulterated elegance and overwhelming power. Standing ashore in the Arabian sea, it enjoys a panoramic and unobstructed view of the diorama created by the merger of the magnetic waves and the azure waters. It also overlooks the mesmerising Mopilla Bay, a natural harbour.
      </p>
      <h5>3.Kannur Lighthouse </h5>
      <p>Being Kerala's first lighthouse ever and Kannur's only one, the Kannur Lighthouse is a pretty big deal. This cylindrical concrete tower has a balcony with a light that is lit as the evening breaks in to alert the seamen of the land.</p>
      <h5>4.Parassinikadavu Snake Park </h5>
      <p>Regarded as one of the finest snake sanctuaries of Asia, the Parassinikadavu Snake Park is the pride of the south. This snake park is one of the most prominent reptile preservation centres in the country and is the only one in Kerala. It is home to over 150 different species of reptiles like crocodiles, monitor lizards and snakes- both venomous and non-venomous.

      </p>
      <h5>5.Palakayyam Thattu </h5>
      <p>Tucked away in the lush greenery of the Western Ghats and soaring at a dizzying altitude of 3500 feet above sea level, Palakayyam Thattu is one of the most beautiful hill stations in the entire state of Kerala. Adorned with luxuriously dense greenery, sky-touching trees and majestic hillocks, the view that Palakayyam Thattu enjoys is one that you will rarely find.</p>
      <h5>6.Ezhimala</h5>
      <p>
        Ezhimala, once served as the capital of erstwhile Mooshika kings, today it is a site of great historical significance. The land has been witness to many great events from war of Chola-Chera to headquarters of the Ezhimala Radii.
      </p>
      <h5>7.Paithalamala </h5>
      <p>
        A small hill station tucked in the forest of Kodagu in the Kannur district of Kerala, Pythal Mala is one of the most beautiful peaks in the Western Ghats that mesmerizes anyone who has been here.
      </p>
      <h5>8.Theyyam </h5>
      <p>
        Bringing life to intriguing myths and exciting legends, the Theyyam festival is one of the most eagerly awaited festivals of the vibrant city of Kannur. Drawing the attention of thousands of people every year from across the country, this festival is renowned as the most remarkable and riveting art form of Malabar, the northern part of Kerala.
